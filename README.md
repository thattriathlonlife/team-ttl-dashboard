# ThatTriathlonLife — Team Dashboard

A private, invite-only race tracking and team coordination platform for ThatTriathlonLife athletes. Built to replace WhatsApp race planning with a purpose-built tool that automatically tracks IRONMAN, 70.3, and triathlon events worldwide.

---

## What It Does

**Home** — Greets each athlete by name and shows who on the team is racing this week, which race they're in, and where in the world it is on an interactive map.

**Races** — A live calendar of upcoming IRONMAN, 70.3, Olympic, Sprint and other triathlon events pulled automatically from global race databases. Filter by organisation and race type, or search by name, location or type. Click any race to see the course profile (swim/bike/run), teammates entered, race description, and a direct registration link. Enter or withdraw from races in one tap.

**My Races** — Your personal race schedule for the season, grouped by month with a countdown to your next race. Export your full schedule to Google Calendar or Apple Calendar in one click.

**Calendar** — Full year view of all upcoming races colour-coded by type.

**Team** — Roster of all active team members and their entered races.

**Messages** — Built-in team messaging to replace WhatsApp. Channels include a General channel, topic channels created by admins, and race-specific threads auto-created when athletes discuss a race. Supports text, image sharing, emoji reactions on messages, Discord-style replies, and @mentions with a dedicated Mentions view and unread badge. Messages are real-time via Supabase subscriptions.

**Profile** — Upload a profile photo, pick an avatar colour, and update your name and contact details.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- A Supabase project (free at supabase.com)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThatTriathlonLife/team-ttl-dashboard
cd team-ttl-dashboard
```

### 2. Set up Supabase
1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to SQL Editor and run the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
3. Go to Authentication → Providers → Email and enable magic links
4. Go to Authentication → URL Configuration and set Site URL to `http://localhost:5173`
5. Add `http://localhost:5173/**` to Redirect URLs

### 3. Configure environment variables
```bash
cd frontend
copy .env.example .env.local
```
Edit `.env.local`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 4. Run the frontend
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### 5. Make yourself admin
After first login, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

---

## Deployment

### Frontend → Vercel
```bash
cd frontend
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```
Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Update Supabase Auth redirect URLs to include your Vercel domain.

### Race Scraper → GitHub Actions
The scraper runs automatically at 6am UTC daily via `.github/workflows/scrape.yml`.

Add these secrets to your GitHub repo (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- `TRIATHLON_API_KEY` *(register free at developers.triathlon.org)*

To trigger manually: GitHub → Actions → Daily Race Scraper → Run workflow.

| Variable | Used In | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Frontend | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Frontend | Supabase public anon key |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Scraper | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Scraper | Supabase service role key (never expose publicly) |
| `TRIATHLON_API_KEY` | Scraper | triathlon.org API key |
| `WHATSAPP_TOKEN` | Scraper *(disabled)* | Meta system user token |
| `WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID` | Scraper *(disabled)* | Meta phone number ID |
| `WHATSAPP_CHANNEL_ID` | Scraper *(disabled)* | WhatsApp channel/group ID |

---

## Database Schema

Key tables in Supabase:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `profiles` | Team members — name, email, avatar, role, WhatsApp number |
| `races` | All races — name, type, date, location, coordinates, source, registration URL |
| `race_entries` | Junction table — which athlete is entered in which race |
| `channels` | Messaging channels — general, topic, and race threads |
| `messages` | Messages — content, image URL, reply_to reference |
| `message_reactions` | Emoji reactions on messages |
| `message_mentions` | @mention tracking — for unread badges and mentions view |
| `channel_reads` | Last-read timestamps per user per channel — for unread counts |
| `notification_log` | Log of WhatsApp notifications sent |

Row Level Security is enabled. Users can only modify their own data. Race and message data is readable by all authenticated users.

---

## Race Data Sources

| Source | Coverage | Method |
|--------|----------|--------|
| triathlon.org API | Olympic, Sprint, World Tri Series | API (free, key required) |
| PTO Race Calendar | IRONMAN Full, 70.3 | Web scraping (cheerio) |

Races are upserted daily — existing entries are preserved when race details update.

---

## Messaging Architecture

Messages use Supabase Realtime (WebSocket subscriptions) for instant delivery. Key design decisions:

- **Optimistic UI** — messages appear immediately on send, confirmed once the database insert completes, with a "Sending..." indicator while in flight
- **Deduplication** — the real-time subscription skips messages already added optimistically by the current user
- **Race threads** — created automatically when an athlete clicks "Discuss This Race" on any race detail, no admin action required
- **@mentions** — parsed client-side from message content, stored in `message_mentions` table, surfaced in the Mentions sidebar view

---

## Roadmap

### In Progress / Planned
- Race history (past races the team has completed)
- Leaderboard
- Admin member management
- CSV race import

### Parked
- WhatsApp notifications *(requires Meta Business account approval)*
- Mobile app integration *(pending review of existing app stack)*
